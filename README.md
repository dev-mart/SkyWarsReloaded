## Repository
The core code of this project is closed-source. This means that it is not possible to see the core code, fork it, or contribute to it.
We have open-sourced the [SkyWarsReloaded-API](https://github.com/dev-mart/SkyWarsReloaded-API).
This repository contains all interfaces and structures that are implemented in different layers of the plugin.

The open-source [SkyWarsReloaded-Bukkit](https://github.com/dev-mart/SkyWarsReloaded-Bukkit) repository contains the Bukkit implementation of the SkyWarsReloaded API. 
This repository contains almost no logic for the plugin itself and is purely a bridge between the Bukkit and the Skywars APIs.

If you wish to contribute to the plugin, and you are an experiences Java developer, you can contact us in [our Discord server](https://www.gcnt.net/discord)._
